# Javscript FPSci
This documentation supports the "FPSci in a broswer" approach developed in this project.

## Current Support
Currently the application is not intended to support full experiments in the style of FPSci. Instead it focuses on programmable user experience for "feel"-based experiences. This means that many controls that would normally be hidden in the FPSci app are available in app here.

In addition no output files are current produced. This could easily be changed in the future.

## Running the Application
The application works in a browser run from one of two modes:

* File hosted mode: Works when not using assets with the application (i.e. no local files/images requires)
* Hosted from `localhost` 

### File Hosted
To open the application in file hosted mode simply open the `index.html` page in a browser of your choice. Here all features will work *except* those that require local file contents.

### Running with Local Host
To run with local host the top-level directory for this project needs to be hosted through `localhost`. This can be done with Python using the `python -m http.server` command and a script ([`open_localhost.bat`](open_localhost.bat)) is provided to do exactly this (plus open the correct URL).

After hosting the directory through `localhost` the application can be accessed by visiting `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.

## Supported Configuration
A variety of configuration from the (Windows) FPSci application is supported in this application. The application can be configured either through loading a JSON file from disk, or by using URL parameters.

Currently supported configuration is provided as a nested list below. The format is: [Parameter Name]: [`URL Parameter Name`] (`type`) = [Default Value].

Typically JSON parameter names are _very_ similar to URL parameter names, but often with less verbosity as they are inherently nested in the configuration dictionary.
